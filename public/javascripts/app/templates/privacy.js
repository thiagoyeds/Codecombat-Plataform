The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. See more</span><a href=\"http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf\">here</a>.</p><p>According to CalOPPA: users can visit our site anonymously; we link to this Privacy Policy on the home page; and our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the home page.</p><p>Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page. Users are able to change their personal information by logging into their account or by emailing us.</p><p><strong>How does our site handle do not track signals?</strong></p><p>We generally attempt to honor Do Not Track (DNT) browser signals when possible but cannot guarantee 100% coverage.</p><p><strong>Does our site allow third party behavioral tracking?</strong></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong></p><p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p><p>We adhere to the following COPPA tenets:<ul><li>We will not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to particapate in our service.</li><li>Parents can agree to the collection and use of their child's information, but still not allow disclosure to third parties.</li><li>Parents can review, delete, and manage their child's information through account settings on our website or by emailing team@codecombat.com.</li><li>We notify parents directly before collecting PII from their children. This includes what specific information will be collected and how it might be disclosed, a link to our online privacy policy, and how parents can give their consent.</li><li>Parents can give consent by creating accounts for their children and providing the minimum necessary personal information needed during that account creation.</li><li>Student accounts for use in school settings can only be created with consent of a teacher.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong></p><p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p><p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur, we will notify the affected users via email within 7 business days.</p><p>We also agree to the individual redress principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government agency to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p><p><strong>CAN-SPAM Act</strong></p><p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p><p>We collect your email address in order to:<ul><li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li><li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders</li><li>We may also send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</li><li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred</li></ul></p><p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM we agree to the following:<ul><li>NOT use false, or misleading subjects or email addresses</li><li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way</li><li>Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters</li><li>Monitor third party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li><li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly</li><li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email</li></ul></p><p>If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can change your email settings in your account preferences, email us, or follow the instructions at the bottom of each email, and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.</p><p><strong>Contacting Us</strong></p><p>If there are any questions regarding this privacy policy you may contact us using the information below.</p><p><span>CodeCombat Inc.</span><br/><span>301 Howard St Suite 830</span><br/><span>San Francisco, CA 94105</span><br/><a href=\"mailto:team@codecombat.com\">team@codecombat.com</a></p><p><em>Last Edited on 2016-10-20</em></p></div><div class=\"achievement-corner\"></div><div id=\"site-footer\"><img id=\"footer-background\" src=\"/images/pages/base/nav_background.png\"/><div" + (jade.attrs({ 'id':('footer-links'), "class": [(features.playViewsOnly ?
